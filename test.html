    <p>The basics of coding is simple to understand but for things like making a sentence or anyother basic part of code it must begin with</p>
    <p>but a suggestion i wouldn't do it constantly otherwise you would do it until it gets boring or burn yourself out by constantly doing it</p>
    <p>you can put sentences in bold, italic, or mix of both</p>
    <p>for making a header you can use h1-5 1 being the biggest and 5 being the smallest</p>
    <p>for example</p>
    <h1>h1</h1>
    <h2>h2</h2>
    <h3>h3</h3>
    <h4>h4</h4>
    <h5>h5</h5>
    <p>h0 and anything bigger than h5 does not work or simple does not exist</p>
    <p>also with code if you don't type the code right you will know because no changes will be made or if you use something like Text for chromebooks rest bits of code will be red</p>
    <p>if you would ask me if how hard it is to code a website i would say its easy but if you asked how hard it is to code someone else's website i would say its difficult because you have no idea what that person wants to be on they're website unless they tell you so ask questions about what they want because making a website for someone else the only tricky part is if they don't communicate and tell you if they want the background blue or red at that point you could politely say sorry i can't create it without you saying how you want it or unless you think of something random and they like it then its fine</p>
